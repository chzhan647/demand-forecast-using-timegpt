### Forecast with TimeGPT
In this notebook, we're exploring store demand forcasting using TimeGPT-1, the first foundational model for time series forecasting. The authors adapt the architecture behind LLMs and trained the model on 100 billion data points from publicly available  data. 

In this exercise, we will use the store-item sales data from a time series competition in Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data) and see how the model performs compared with deep learning or ARIMA when perdicting 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.
